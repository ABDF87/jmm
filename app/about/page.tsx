          Who I am
          <br />
          <br />
          I am a food photographer based in San Francisco. I take bold colorful
          rich in contrast photographs that embrace the rich cultural background
          of diverse subjects while devoting special attention to color
          temperature, sculpture presence and composition. My inspiration is
          rooted in still life painting, with an emphasis on Impressionism,
          French and Russian.
